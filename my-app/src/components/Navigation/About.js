            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>We created goVid because we kept seeing articles about what cities and counties were doing to implemet proper steps toward opening up and implementing safety
                regulations for everyone living in the area. We wanted to make things simple for the next person that was searching! Here on goVid you can see who
                your representatives are in both the House of Representatives, the Senate, as well as your governor and their contact information.
