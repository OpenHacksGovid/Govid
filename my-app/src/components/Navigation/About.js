            <p>goVid's mission is to provide government data for your needs during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>goVid was created because we kept seeing articles about what cities and counties were doing to implement proper steps toward opening up and implementing safety
                regulations for everyone living in the area. We wanted to make things simple for the next person that was searching! check on goVid to see who
                your representatives are in both the House of Representatives, the Senate, as well as your governor's Twitter handle and their contact information. If you are having
                trouble with unemployment please hover on your state and click the link to state unemployment website where you can find the appropriate information to be taken care of
                during this pandemic.
