            <p>We created Govid because we kept seeing articles about what cities and counties were doing to implemet proper steps into opening up and safety
                regulations for everyone living in the area and we wanted to make things simple for the next person that was searching! Here at Govid you can see who
                is in your House of Rep as well as your governor, a link to their website/Twitter and websites that can give you more information
